we need to get the info for the api from
https://developer.accuweather.com/apis
Then must go to locations API and get the location, then 
also to the current condition or forecast api for the other 
information for the location api.

for the location, we input the API key and a location, then need to get the 
"key" (probably near the top) for the location. (key value pair)
